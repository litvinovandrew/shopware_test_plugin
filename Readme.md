# SingleCategoryPlugin

TASK
Implement a plugin in the latest version of Shopware 5 Community Edition (5.6.6),
which brings the following changes / functions in the listing and on the detail page.

Task 1:
If a category contains only one article, the listing of this category should automatically redirect to this
article.

Task 1.1:
On the detail page of products, breadcrumb entries of affected categories should no longer be linked,
because the link of this entry would lead back to the article due to the forwarding logic from task 1.
